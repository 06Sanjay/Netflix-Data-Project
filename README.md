# Netflix Data: Cleaning ,Analysis and Visualization

#Overview of Netflix dataset:
Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows,
and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which
can be found here. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021.
The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be
cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to
test my data cleaning and visualization skills.
The Netflix Story project is a data analysis, cleaning  and visualization project that focuses on examining and presenting insights from Netflix-related data.
The primary goal of this project is to leverage Tableau to explore, analyze, and visualize the dataset. By doing so, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting insights related to Netflix's content library, viewership, and more.
It contains comprehensive information about Netflix titles, including details like title, type (movie or TV show), release year, country, duration, and more. The dataset is crucial for conducting in-depth analyses and creating informative visualizations.

Conclusion and Insights
In this project, we:
1. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and
converting data types.
2. Explored the data through various visualizations such as bar plots and word
clouds.
3. Analyzed content trends over time, identified popular genres, and highlighted
top directors.



1. Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as counting the number of
genres per movie or extracting the duration in minutes.
2. Machine Learning: Use the cleaned and processed data to build models for
recommendations or trend predictions.
3. Advanced Visualization: Use interactive plots or dashboards for more detailed
analysis.




This project is a foundational exercise that introduces essential data analysis
techniques, paving the way for more advanced projects.
